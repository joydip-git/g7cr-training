1. interface in TS
	a. It is an extra feature in TS. there is no corresponding representation of the same in transpiled code. Interface is simply ignored in transpiled code
	b. interface is a collection of abstract members. only declaration, but no definition
	c. data and functionalities can be declared in interface
	d. can't create object based on interface
	e. members are by default public, no access specifiers are used with them
	f. a variable of an interface can store reference of any child class object (upcasting)
	g. an interface, if implemented in a class, must implement all interface members
	h. interface is manily for typification, abstraction, loose cpupling in s/w architecture etc.
	i. interface can be inherited in another interface
